# Portfolio1.1
Portfolio for Marla C. Wright, UX Designer.  
This project was a larger undertaking than I had anticipated. Many thanks to John (asowneryt) from fiverr, Gus, chatgpt, w3schools, Tim Gabe, developedbyed, Rocksauce, Figma youtube tutorials, Arnau Ros, Mavi Design, Designwith Arash, and GoDaddyPro for helping me accomplish this feat. 

Through it all, I gained more empathy for front-end developers. <3
