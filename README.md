Portfolio for Marla C. Wright, UX Designer.  
This project was a larger undertaking than I had anticipated. Many thanks to Gus, chatgpt, w3schools, Tim Gabe , developedbyed, Rocksauce, Figma youtube tutorials, Arnau Ros, Mavi Design, Designwith Arash, and GoDaddyPro for helping me accomplish this feat.
