        <p>Government websites are notorious for having bad design.  Users are often frustrated trying to find the information they are searching for. For this project, I chose to redesign the australia post office navigation and homepage. </p></div>

          <p>Ken owns a small printing business in australia, where he resides.  As Ken's business has grown, his need for using the postal service has grown.  The current website feels convoluted and hard to navigate.<p>

        <h5 class="media-body mr-3">Usability Testing</h5>
        <h6 class="mt-0 mb-1">Objective</h6>
        <p>To better understand where users struggle using the australia post office website, which parts aren't functional, and where the navigation and homepage can be improved.</p>
        <h6 class="media-body mt-0 mb-1">KPI's</h6>
        <p>Do users struggle with using the navigation and website? Does the user have to click the "Back" button because navigation was unclear?</p>  </div>
        <div class="media">
        <img src="./media/clippedpainpoints.png" alt="Users wished there was more iconography and clearer navigation as well as CTA buttons." class="img-fluid mr-3 shadow">

          <div class="media-body">
          <h5 class="mt-o mb-1">Heuristic Evaluation</h5><p>The biggest issue with the homepage was its accessibility and performance.  According to the lighthouse report, the homepage scored 50% in performance, and from my own research using the 6 main colors, the homepage had a 60% failure rate for accessibility.  You can see my color audit <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0A5y9Z8o1qSMFwNXmfq9iB7bsAolx5JOa9MxtEXkR8/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="list-item-2">Define</h4><h5>Card Sort</h5>
        <p>Users were frustrated that there was multiple ways to carry out an action within the megamenu. I sorted all of the L1, and L2 options, deleted duplicates, and tried to group them more intuitively.</p><h5>Updated Site Map</h5><p>Many items were nested farther than the L2. The 'Tools' section was deleted and converted into a CTA bar that was visible above the fold.</p> 
        <h4 id="list-item-3">Ideate</h4>
        <p>My efforts were concentrated on the main navigation for desktop and mobile views. </p>
        <h4 id="list-item-4">Prototype</h4>
